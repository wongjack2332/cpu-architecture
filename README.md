# Python Von Neumann architecture

## Von neumann architecture

- von neumann is an american scientists who came up with the concept of a computer we now all use, one that is not pre programmed by stores a program and can run different programs without chaning the hardware and reconfiguring the computer. 
- more about von neumann architecture on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture

## Installation
- you have to have python installed in order to run this program. 
- python: version 3.7 or above.

## concept
- this code is a demonstration on how the von neumann architecture of the cpu works. Edit the ram in mode 1 and execute them in mode 2
- in execution, you will be able to choose a time delay and that will delay the execution by a lot more than what it is capable to run on.
